### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd when-to-visit

3. Configure Firebase

Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

Update the Firebase configuration in `src/services/firebase.js` with your own Firebase project details:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
